# 🏢 Conference Room Booking System

This repository contains a practice project used to demonstrate professional Git, GitHub, and collaboration workflows.

The project simulates a Conference Room Booking System that will be expanded over multiple modules to support learning around documentation, APIs, teamwork, and system handover.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is used to practise and demonstrate:
- Git and GitHub collaboration workflows
- Pull Requests as structured communication
- Sprint-based documentation
- Professional handover and onboarding practices

The system will evolve incrementally across modules as new technical concepts are
introduced.

## Developer Onboarding (In Progress)
- This project is developed incrementally as part of a Software training program. The purpose of this section is to help new contributors to understand 
- What this system is intended to become
- How documentation  is organised
- Where to find key project artefacts
-  What technologies will be used to develop this project?

## System Context (High-Level)

The Conference Room Booking System is a conceptual application intended to support:
- Viewing conference room availability
- Creating and managing booking requests
- Preventing booking conflicts
- Administrative oversight of rooms and bookings

Currently, the system exists primarily as **documentation and planning artefacts** produced
during sprint simulations. Implementation details will be introduced in later modules.

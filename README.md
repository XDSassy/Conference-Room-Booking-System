# 🏢 Conference Room Booking System

This repository contains a practice project used to demonstrate professional Git, GitHub, and collaboration workflows.

The project simulates a Conference Room Booking System that will be expanded over multiple modules to support learning around documentation, APIs, teamwork, and system handover.

## Project Overview

The Conference Room Booking System is a **training project** used to simulate the
development of an internal system for managing conference room availability and bookings
within an organization.

The primary audience for this repository is:
- Developers participating in sprint simulations
- Reviewers assessing documentation and collaboration practices
- New contributors onboarding into the project during later modules

At this stage, the repository focuses on **professional communication, documentation, and
collaboration workflows** rather than a complete software implementation.

## 🗂 Repository Contents

- `README.md` – Basic project overview
- `sprint/` – Sprint planning and execution artefacts created during Scrum simulations
- `.gitignore` – Git ignore rules
- `LICENSE` – Project licens

---

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is used to practise and demonstrate:
- Git and GitHub collaboration workflows
- Pull Requests as structured communication
- Sprint-based documentation
- Professional handover and onboarding practices

The system will evolve incrementally across modules as new technical concepts are
introduced.

## System Context (High-Level)

The Conference Room Booking System is a conceptual application intended to support:
- Viewing conference room availability
- Creating and managing booking requests
- Preventing booking conflicts
- Administrative oversight of rooms and bookings

Currently, the system exists primarily as **documentation and planning artefacts** produced
during sprint simulations. Implementation details will be introduced in later modules.

## Developer Onboarding (In Progress)
- This project is developed incrementally as part of a Software training program. The purpose of this section is to help new contributors to understand 
- What this system is intended to become
- How documentation  is organised
- Where to find key project artefacts
-  What technologies will be used to develop this project?
-

## Project Documentation
This repository contains sprint documentation created during Scrum Simulations:
- `sprint-1\`- Sprint planning, execution and review artefacts

---

## Upcoming Documentation

The following sections will be added as the project evoles
- API documentations (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Runtime instructions (Docker)
- Developer setup and contribution workflow

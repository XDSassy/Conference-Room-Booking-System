The original README assumed that the reader already had sprint context and prior
knowledge of the project goals, structure, and constraints. It functioned more as a
reminder for existing team members rather than an onboarding tool for new developers.

The updated README improves onboarding by clearly explaining what the system does,
who it is for, and how a developer can begin engaging with the repository. By adding
system context, contribution workflows, and explicit placeholders for future
documentation, it sets expectations while acknowledging the system’s evolving state.

Through the Pull Request process, I learned how documentation changes benefit from
the same review discipline as code. Writing a PR description forced me to articulate
intent, scope, and review focus, which reduced ambiguity for reviewers. Similarly,
using structured issue templates demonstrated how good issue design minimizes
back-and-forth communication and helps contributors act confidently.

Overall, this assignment reinforced that professional communication is not incidental
to development—it is part of the deliverable. Clear documentation, well-scoped Pull
Requests, and structured issues directly improve team efficiency and shared
understanding.

# Presentation Self-Evaluation

## Clarity of Explanation
I think my explanation during the presentation was clear and easy to understand for the intended audience. In some areas, I moved through details quickly to stay within the time limit, but I believe the main ideas and purpose of the system were communicated clearly.

## Technical Accuracy
I made an effort to use correct technical terms when explaining the project, especially when speaking to a more technical audience. At the same time, I tried not to overcomplicate explanations for non-technical listeners. I was clear when referring to the main technical components of the system, but I could improve by explaining in more detail how different parts of the software work together and what technical skills are required to work on the project.

## Structure and Flow
The presentation followed a clear structure based on the assignment guidelines, which helped the content flow well from one section to the next. Each slide focused on a specific topic, making the presentation easy to follow. The overall design of the slides was consistent and supported the information being presented.

## Confidence in Delivery
I felt fairly confident when delivering the presentation because I understood the project and the work that went into it. I was aware that different audiences require different levels of explanation. However, I could improve by slowing down my speaking pace, taking time to breathe, and clearly pronouncing my words to avoid rushing.

## Improvements for Next Time
For future presentations, I would:
- Slow down when speaking to improve clarity  
- Spend more time explaining important details  
- Make more eye contact with the audience to check understanding
